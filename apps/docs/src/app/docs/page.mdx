## 👀 How it works?

1. 🔄 Fit your 3D model (glasses, hat, etc.) on a standard face model.
2. ✨ Add a few lines of code to your app.
3. 🤓 Your 3D model aligns on the user’s face!

## 🧠 Current limitations & workarounds

Mediapipe face landmarker task is currently in beta and has a few limitations.

### 1. Partial face mesh

#### Limitation

Unlike Snapchat, which provides a full face mesh including the skull, full forehead, and ears, Mediapipe only offers a front-facing mesh with a partial forehead.
This makes proper occlusion difficult for example, the temple tips of glasses that are behind ears remain visible due to missing ears.
Similary the bottom of a cap that is covered by skull remains visible due to missing skull.
[Issue #2104](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/issues/2104)
[Issue #5595](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/issues/5944)

#### Workaround

We add invisible 3D objects representing the ears, skull, and forehead.
These act as occluders blocking parts of 3D objects (like glasses) that should appear behind the skull/ears.

### 2. Misaligned Objects When Face Isn't Centered

#### Limitation

The face transform matrix from Mediapipe doesn’t reliably align objects to the face especially when the face is off-center.
[Issue #4759](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/issues/4759)

#### Workaround

We add visual indicator (a box with green border) to define a "safe area" where the face should remain for accurate alignment.
